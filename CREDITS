Thank you BlockBa5her for taking inspiration from my source and editting DispatchSystem 
(posted here: https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-dispatchsystem-v1-0/44848,
with source here: http://github.com/blockba5her/dispatchsystem), 
who in turn inspired me to continue working on this project and got some ideas from looking at what he did differently in his source.
We both code review each other :).
